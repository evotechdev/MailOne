N1 is built on the Nylas Sync Engine, which is also [open-source free software](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine).\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nylas/N1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nylas/N1)\r\n[![Slack Invite Button](http://slack-invite.nylas.com/badge.svg)](http://slack-invite.nylas.com)\r\n[![GitHub issues On Deck](https://badge.waffle.io/nylas/N1.png?label=on deck&title=On Deck)](https://waffle.io/nylas/N1)\r\n\r\n#### Want help build the future of email? [Nylas is hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/nylas)!\r\n\r\n# Download N1\r\n\r\nYou can download compiled versions of N1 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (.deb) from [https://nylas.com/N1](https://nylas.com/N1). You can also build and run N1 on Fedora. A Fedora distribution is coming soon! On Arch Linux, you can install **[n1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/n1/)** or **[n1-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/n1-git/)** from the aur.\r\n\r\n# Build A Plugin\r\n\r\nPlugins lie at the heart of N1 and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide](http://nylas.com/N1/getting-started/) to write your first plugin in five minutes. To create your own theme, go to our [Theme Starter guide](http://github.com/nylas/N1-theme-starter).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to run the N1 source and contribute, check out our [contributing\r\nguide](https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n# Plugin List\r\nWe're working on building a plugin index that makes it super easy to add them to N1. For now, check out the list below!
